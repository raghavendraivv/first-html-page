	<h2>Played from: 2007-2020</h2>
	<h3>               Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi waited for the birth of his second child.'Dhoniiiii, finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years. The party has started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent, in the night of the final.’ Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni enchanted the Wankhede on the 2nd of April 2011.</h3>
       <h2> Foundation</h2>
	<h3>                    Hailing from Jharkhand living in Ranchi, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper-batsmen, a teen-aged Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenaged boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the better fast bowlers of the district. However, Dhoni found it difficult to make the cut against wicket-keeping candidates of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector for at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet. </h3><br>
	<h2>Captiancy for Test, IPL, ODI</h2>
	<h3>			echnique
There have always been questions about Dhoni's technique, and how ugly it looks. And the assessment of Dhoni's technique points out one of the major follies in our game - the temptation to judge by aesthetics rather than functionality. Technique is a product of how you get something done and not a step by step physical procedure as to how to do it. The method to achieve the fundamental virtues of the game rely on your abilities and aptitude to execute them in a particular way. Dhoni looks unorthodox at the crease, but he gets back and across. Instead of punching with his fore-arms, he bludgeons it with his wrists, with a low back-lift, ensuring that he plays it late. Most importantly, he has a still head while perceiving the line of the ball and at the point of contact. He also has an open stance allowing him to pull easily by getting to the back-foot early.</h3><br><br>

	<h3>			After the World Cup, the Indian team saw a difficult transition period. Dhoni's shrewd captaincy came under severe scrutiny during the 8 successive losses in England and Australia. In the aftermath of the overseas failure, a fatigued Indian side, with an overkill of cricket in the calendar, faced a 1-2 drubbing against England at home after which there were serious questions about Dhoni's leadership and a whisper of his sacking; a somewhat misplaced and impulsive proposition, given the poor overall performance of the entire team, their inept technique against spin (which is their forte), an overflowing timetable, and a plethora of viable explanations. </h3>
