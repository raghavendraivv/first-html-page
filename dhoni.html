	<h3>               Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi waited for the birth of his second child.'Dhoniiiii, finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years. The party has started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent, in the night of the final.’ Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni enchanted the Wankhede on the 2nd of April 2011.</h3>
       <h2> Foundation</h2>
	<h3>                    Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, a teen-aged Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenaged boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the better fast bowlers of the district. However, Dhoni found it difficult to make the cut against wicket-keeping candidates of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector for at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet. </h3><br>
	<h2>Captiancy</h2>
	<h3>			With a mature head on his shoulders and an astute and shrewd cricketing mind, Dhoni was recommended by senior players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper. <br>
				On his first assignment in the inaugural World T20 in 2007, Dhoni and his young troops romped to the title in a shock victory for the inexperienced Indian side, bringing about the T20 revolution in India. Dhoni's calm and composed leadership was widely lauded in the cricketing fraternity after India brought the trophy home, earning him the label of ‘Captain Cool’ and 'great Indian captian'. He was soon handed the ODI leadership as a natural move after his World T20 triumph, and after the retirement of Anil Kumble in late 2008, the Test leadership was thrust upon him too. </h3><br><br>

	<h3>			After the World Cup, the Indian team saw a difficult transition period. Dhoni's shrewd captaincy came under severe scrutiny during the 8 successive losses in England and Australia. In the aftermath of the overseas failure, a fatigued Indian side, with an overkill of cricket in the calendar, faced a 1-2 drubbing against England at home after which there were serious questions about Dhoni's leadership and a whisper of his sacking; a somewhat misplaced and impulsive proposition, given the poor overall performance of the entire team, their inept technique against spin (which is their forte), an overflowing timetable, and a plethora of viable explanations. </h3>
